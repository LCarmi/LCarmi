## Hi there 👋
I'm Luca 🇮🇹, currently PhD Student at Politecnico di Milano (expected graduation Jan 2025).

Some info:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on solving decision problems at scale. In particular:
  - 🛩️ Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-UAV Control
  - 🃏 solving big imperfect information games, with a team twist!
- 🌱 Currently learning `JAX` and the novel `FLAX.nnx` and playing with Llama 3
- 📕 Probably reading some Sci-fi book (suggesting Ubik by P.K.Dick 🎆)
- 📫 How to reach me: write an email at `<myname> dot carminati at hotmail dot it`... ask me about anything 🤗

### ⚡ Currently working on:
- 🎓 Writing my PhD Thesis
- 🧪 Extending the Team Games frameworks to automatically reorder games if computationally advantageous
- 📖 Writing journal papers on Monte-Carlo sampling and my whole PhD's _Team game lore_
- 🛩️ Preparing a journal submission on effective techniques for _Mission Planning_ with RL for Multi-UAVs
- 👨🏻‍💻 My own RL library, focused on seamlessly dealing with multimodal inputs and hybrid action spaces
 
Here you can have my CV if interested: [CV - Luca Carminati.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16575942/CV.-.Luca.Carminati.pdf)

PS: My profile picture is a realistic portrait of me debugging, which I am probably doing right now. [Original here](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/228385)
